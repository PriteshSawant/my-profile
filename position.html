  <p> Technological change is the largest cause of long-term economic growth.[58][59] Throughout human history,

    energy production was the main constraint on economic development, and new technologies allowed humans to
    significantly increase the amount of available energy.
    First came fire, which made edible a wider variety of foods, and made it less physically demanding to digest them.
    Fire also enabled smelting, and
    the use of tin, copper, and iron tools, used for hunting or tradesmanship.
    hen came the agricultural revolution: humans no longer needed to hunt or gather to survive, and began to settle in
    towns and cities, forming more complex societies, with militaries and more organized forms of religion.[60]

    Technologies have contributed to human welfare through increased prosperity, improved comfort and quality of life,
    and
    medical progress, but they can also disrupt existing social hierarchies, cause pollution, and harm individuals or
    groups.

    Recent years have brought about a rise in social media's cultural prominence, with potential repercussions on
    democracy, and
    Modern research has turned to investigate the internet's downsides, including disinformation, polarization, hate
    speech, and propaganda.[61]

    Since the 1970s, technology's impact on the environment has been criticized, leading to a surge in investment in
    solar, wind, and other forms of clean energy</p>
